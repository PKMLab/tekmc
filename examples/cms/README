This is one configuration of CO2 caged inside 6F-CMS membrane [1].

>> inputs.py sets up the required inputs
>> run.py is used to run the tekmc method
>> The bash scripts help executing many sets of (gas, temperature, pressure) on a typical HPC set-up
>> In the directory 'system'
  - The file name indicates 50 mer CMS with CO2 gas adsorbed
  - Temperature = 308 K
  - Pressure 2e6 Pa (20 bar)
  - 50mer_s_CO2_308K_2e6Pa_CO2.gro : Topology file containing the centre of mass of the gas, identifier atom name is "CO2".
  - 50mer_s_CO2_308K_2e6Pa_CO2.dcd : Trajectory file of the above topology
>> script.initation.sh
  - Sets up the initial search for grid sizes by performing short tekmc runs for a lot of d_grid values 
  - The mean squared error is used to find the optimal d_grid
  - This search of d_grid helps to tune the MSD from TEKMC with that of the short MD [2]
>> script.optimization.sh
  - Fetches output of inititation to find a finer d_grid
  - Runs are performed for a slightly longer duration
>> script.production.sh
  - Perform the long tekmc runs for three best d_grid values
